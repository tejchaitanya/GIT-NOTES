Git uses three components when working on the local machine
1 Working directory or Workspace
2 Stagging Area
3 Local Repository

Working directory is the folder where the code or the configuration
files are created.Initially the files present here are called as 
Untracked files

Stagging Area is the intermediate buffer zone of git into which 
files temporarly move for indexing purpose and the files present 
here are called as indexed files

Local Repository is the location where version controlling happens and
files present here are called as Commited files

1 To initilise the current folder as a git repo
  git init
  Note: This will create a hidden folder called as .git which stores all
  the configuration necessary for git to run.

2 To send a file from working dir to stagging area
  git add filename
  To send multiple files to stagging area
  git add file1 file2 file3
  To send all the files and folders into the stagging area
  git add .
  Note  . represents present working directory

3 To remove files from the stagging area and bring them back to 
  untracked section
  git rm --cached filename
  (or)
  git reset filename

4 To send the files from the stagging area to the local repository
  git commit -m "Some Message"

5 To see the status of the files present in the untracked and stagging areas
  git status

6 To see the commit history of the local repository
  git log
  To see the commit history in short format
  git log --oneline


===================================================
.gitignore
==============
This is a special configuration file which is sued for hiding
private files from git.Any file whose name is mentioned in 
.gitignore become unaccesble by git

1 Create few file
  touch file1 file2 file3 file4 file5

2 Check the status of git
  git status
  It will show all the above 5 files as untracked files

3 To hide file1-file3 from git
  cat > .gitignore
  file1
  file2
  file3
  To come out of cat command ctrl+d

4 Check the status of git
  git status
  file1-file3 will no longer be show as untracked files
  git cannot access those files
