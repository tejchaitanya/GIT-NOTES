Version Controlling
=======================
All the team members upload their code into a remote server
which is called as code repository or a version controlling
system.This Version Controlling system accepts the code uploads multiple team members
and it integrates the code into a single project.Next time
when the team members download the code they will be able to
access not only their code but also the code created by the
entire team.

Version Controlling system’s preserve older and later versions of the code so that the
team members can toggle between what ever version they want

Version Controlling system ‘s keep a track of who is making what kind of changes at what time

Version Controlling system ‘s are classified into 2 types
============================================

All the team members simply upload their code(checkin) into this
remote servers

Distributed Version Controlling

Here we have a local repository on every team members machine where
the code is committed into and in the local repository version
controlling happens at the level of the individual team member
Later this can be checkedin into a remote server where version
controlling happens at the level of the entire team.
