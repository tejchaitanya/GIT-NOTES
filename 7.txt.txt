Git Stash
===============
This is a section og git where we can store the files
and once files are stored in this section further of
git cannot touch those files until they are unstashed

This is generally used to store unfinished or semi finished
work and continue with some other functionality code.

1 To stash all the files present in the stagging area
  git stash 

2 To stash all the files present in the stagging area and untracked section
  git stash -u

3 To stash all the files present in the stagging area,untracked section and   also the .gitignore file
  git stash -a

4 To see the list of stashes
  git stash list

5 To unstash the lastest stash
  git stash pop

6 To unstash an older stash
  git stash pop stash@{stashno}

.gitignore is a hidden file of git which is used for storing
the name of private/secret files.Any file whose name is mentioned
in .gitignore remains unaccessable by git.But .gitignore itself
can be accesed by git,which means .gitignore moves into the stagging
area,local reposiotry and the remote git repository

To prevent this and make .gitignore hidden from git
git stash -a
